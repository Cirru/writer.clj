## Cirru Writer in Clojure

Format Cirru code in Clojure.

### Where's Clojure code

Code for `src/` and `test/` is generated via code in `cirru-src`, so I do not want to commit code twice.
You can still read [Sepal.clj](https://github.com/Cirru/sepal.clj) like reading Clojure.

## Usage

```clojure
```
